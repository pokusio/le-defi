# Le DÃ©fi (I dare anyone in the world)

_Important Update : As you will see on issue numer 3 in this repo, One person took the challenge, and I thank him very much for that, also of course will test out everything, and obviously quotie him and thank him about it!_

Does the blockchain exists ? 

This is a question that rose, recently. Indeed, I am a curious an by nature, and I dare anyone in this world, to bring in any proof, that there exists any open source blockchain technology, anywhere, in this world.



So I dare you, to open an issue on this repo, and bring in a proof.

The conditions for a proof to be accepted : 
* Only one, for the time being, the proof should consist of an entirely automated installation process (no interactivity, or almost none)
* You must provide complete source code, and fully automated process for building from source all binaries.
* The entire blockchain must not lose any feature, at all, I f I run it on a compeltely private infrastructure, all completely disconnected from the public internet.

Today, in 2020, if you say you are the author or even contributor, to any open source blockchain project, and at the same time, say that it is too much work, to automate its installation and build from source, I say you are a liar.


And since the discussions with the people I cross roads with, on the Blockchain subject, keeps being just youtube beer non-sense, I decided to open this repo, where I challenge anyone in this world, to give a proof, that there exist any open source blockchain project in this world (whose name does not start with the **`b`** letter).


And until anyone in this world gives a proof, I will make every engineer, in every bar, and in every conference room in this world, admit he does not have any proof, of the existence of any free open source blockchain project : 

Either he admits it, or he opens an issue on this repo, and give the proof. Or he can keep saying things, and let all of his friends, weeks after week, witness that he never opened any issue, and did not give any proof.


Also, I will explain to all of those interested in the subject, that obviously, if such a project actually existed, it would take just five seconds to any engineer in this world to bring in a proof : 
 
* we all, every last one of us, prepare automated recipes for our companies' products.
* so giving a proof would take 5 to ten seconds : giving an http link to the README.md that explains how to use the automated recipes.


# How to defeat me

Open an issue, and give the link to a publicly available two automated recipes : 
* one that successfully provisions a Blockchain
* one that sucessfully builds from source all the binaries used by the first automated recipe (which provisions a Blockchain)

## The broken list

Finally, I will not just wait for a proof : 
* every time I fall on anything that looks like a blockchain
* I am going to try
* If it works, I will publishe automated recipe here, to give a proof, put an end to boring stupid conversations
* and finally can get pissed off with beer and interestign, intelligent matters.
* but until there exists one such proof, I will increase the list of people who publish things about the blockchain, pretending "it works", while I have iosolated bugs, and nothing actually works : 
  * I have called  it **the broken list**.
  * It a a list of issues I have opened, with for each, a fully docuemented process to reporduce the bug I reported.


Because I think it is the least we can do, to have a scientific proof of anything we state to people who pay, and trust us, engineers.


## The broken list board

To make the challenge more exicting, I will hit a lot of projects whose name start with the **`b`**  letter, so that none of them escape the challenge. My current work is on bitcoin https://github.com/pokusio/le-defi/issues/1

* **The Helm project/ethereum** provides a set of "curated" charts :! 
  * published in their "curated charts" a broken recipe about `ethereum`, which does not work : 
    * https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/22233 
    * https://github.com/helm/charts/issues/22009#issuecomment-623066641
